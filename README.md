# firmware.bmc.openbmc.yocto.openbmc-meta-intel
This repo contains the openbmc-meta-intel layer that is used to build Intel`s
OpenBMC firmware supporting Intel's reference platforms.

This repo will be updated based on Intel Best-Known Configuration (BKC)
releases. Each release will be provided as a single squashed commit. The
compatible version of the [Linux Foundation (LF) OpenBMC repo][1] will be
included in each commit message.

## How to build Intel-BMC
1. `git clone` the [LF OpenBMC repo][1] into a folder named `openbmc-openbmc`
2. `git clone` this repo into a folder named
`openbmc-openbmc/openbmc-meta-intel`
3. In `openbmc-openbmc/openbmc-meta-intel`, `git checkout` the BKC version to
build and check the commit message for the compatible LF OpenBMC version
4. In `openbmc-openbmc`, `git checkout` the compatible LF OpenBMC version
5. Set TEMPLATECONF to the layer for the desired platform. For example, to
build meta-bhs use:
```sh
export TEMPLATECONF=openbmc-meta-intel/meta-bhs/conf/templates/default
```
6. Source the init script
```sh
source oe-init-build-env
```
7. Edit the `openbmc-openbmc/build/conf/local.conf` file as desired, see
[these-instructions](#How-to-prepare-localconf) for examples
8. If building a signed image, see [these instructions](#how-to-prepare-keys)
to prepare keys
9. Build with
```sh
bitbake intel-platforms
```

When completed, the binaries will be available under
`openbmc-openbmc/build/tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/pfr_images`. The full SPI
ROM image will be under a symlink named `image-mtd-pfr.bin`, and the Redfish
update image will be under a symlink named `bmc_signed_cap.bin`

If enabled, there will also be D-segment equivalent images present.

## How to prepare local.conf
The local.conf file contains various options to configure the build. Here are
some common configuration changes that may be desired:

* Enable `debug-tweaks` for debug features and default credentials
* Comment out `optee` feature lines if the source is inaccessible
* Remove any inaccessible `advanced features` from the
`EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES:append` list

## How to prepare keys
When building Intel-BMC, the common configurations will require keys to sign
the image. The keys are not included with the source, so they must be made
available locally during the build.

### Adding keys for Intel Platform Firmware Resiliency (PFR) builds
A common configuration of Intel-BMC is a PFR-enabled build. This build requires
two key-pairs and a certificate. In platforms where PFR is provisioned, these
keys must match the platform keys.

Otherwise, local keys can be generated to complete the build. The build may be
configured to automatically generate and include local keys. If the build
doesn't support this, local keys can be manually included as follows:

Generate local keys using these commands:
```sh
mkdir -p openbmc-openbmc/openbmc-meta-intel/keys
cd openbmc-openbmc/openbmc-meta-intel
openssl ecparam -out keys/csk_prv.pem -name secp384r1 -genkey
openssl ec -in keys/csk_prv.pem -pubout -out keys/csk_pub.pem
openssl ecparam -out keys/rk_prv.pem -name secp384r1 -genkey
openssl ec -in keys/rk_prv.pem -pubout -out keys/rk_pub.pem
openssl req -new -key keys/rk_prv.pem -x509 -nodes -days 365 -out keys/rk_cert.pem
```

Include these local keys in the build by providing the path to the key file in
the call to `external-signing-utility`. These calls are found in the following files
in the meta-layer you are building:

* recipes-intel/intel-pfr/obmc-intel-pfr-image-native.bbappend
* recipes-intel/intel-pfr/obmc-intel-pfr-image-native/bmc_config.xml
* recipes-intel/intel-pfr/obmc-intel-pfr-image-native/pfm_config.xml

If enabled, you will also need to set the local keys for D-segment:

* recipes-intel/intel-pfr/obmc-intel-pfr-image-native/bmc_config_d.xml
* recipes-intel/intel-pfr/obmc-intel-pfr-image-native/pfm_config_d.xml
