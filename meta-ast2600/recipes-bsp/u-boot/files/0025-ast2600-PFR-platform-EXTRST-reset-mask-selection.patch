Subject: [PATCH] ast2600-PFR-platform-EXTRST-reset-mask-selection

This commit will enable specific reset mask for EXTRST# signal.
On PFR platforms, EXTRST# signal is used by PFR CPLD to put BMC
in reset during firmware authentications, recovery and firmware
update flow, during which certain modules of BMC should be chosen
to be reset so that Host functionality would be intact.
