Subject: [PATCH] Add logs to fwVersionIsSame()

Add logs to fwVersionIsSame() to indicate whether the firmware
version is changed or not.

Tested:
Logs are printed as expected when firmware updating and BMC rebooting.

Log of rebooting:
The firmware version is similiar as the last boot,
Hash value of versionFile is:3336889560

Log of Firmware update:
The firmware version is changed since the last boot,
hash value of current versionFile is:3336889560,
hash value of versionFile of last boot is:834871226
