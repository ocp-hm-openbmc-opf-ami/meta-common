Subject: [PATCH] remove image file on pre-script failures

Multiple back-to-back updates of bad images will cause the software
manager to leave junk images hanging around. This is part of a fix that
will remove them if the software manager never gets around to launching
the fwupd.sh script. The other part is that the fwupd.sh script must
always delete the image file on exit, success or failure.

Tested: posted a garbage file, saw that it was deleted even though
        fwupd.sh was never invoked.
