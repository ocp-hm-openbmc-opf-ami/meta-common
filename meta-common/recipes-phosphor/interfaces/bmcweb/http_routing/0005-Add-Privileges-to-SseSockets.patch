Subject: [PATCH] Add Privileges to SseSockets

This commit adds Privileges to Ssesockets.
In the current implementation, once a rule is upgraded (i.e. from
BaseRule to SseSocket), there is no provision to add priviliges.
In this commit, SseSocket inherits PrivilegeParameterTraits to
enable privileges.

Also, in the earlier implementation, .privilege() was called after
BMCWEB_ROUTE(). This results in adding those privileges to the Base
rule that is created. By moving the privileges() below websocket(),
the privileges are applied to the Ssesocket.

Tested:
 - SSE Subscription was successful with Admin and Operator Users
 - SSE Subscription was rejected while using Readonly User
 - websocket_test.py Passed
 - Admin and Operator users were able to access KVM on WebUI
 - Readonly User was unable to access KVM on WebUI
