Subject: [PATCH] Fix Adaptor scope issue in upgraded connection

Ownership of adaptor was moved to lambda function handling
upgraded connection.
Due to this, during any error(Example :Insufficient privilege) when
the control goes back to http_connection to send error response,
the adaptor will be invalid leading to crash.
This commit retains the ownership of adaptor until connection
is upgraded.
